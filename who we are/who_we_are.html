           <p> Look, just because I don't be givin'
           no man a foot massage don't make it
           right for Marsellus to throw Antwone
           into a glass motherfuckin'house, fuckin' up the
           way the nigger talks. Motherfucker do that shit to
           me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause
           I'll kill the motherfucker, know what I'm sayin'?</p>

           <p> Do you see any Teletubbies in here?
           Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt
           with my name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian
           child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside
           on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters
           in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a toy store. And you must
           think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping for an
           infant named Jeb. </p>
